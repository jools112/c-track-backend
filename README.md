# c-track-backend version 1

## Dependencies:
* Flask 1.1.2
* Python 3.9
* sqlite3
* pip 21.01
* flask_cors

## Installation: 
* Create an empty database file `database.sqlite3`. 
* Import `schema.sql` to the database (if using SQLiteStudio, copy the entire file and paste it into the SQL editor, make sure to have the entire query selected before pressing `run`) no: execute sql from file.
* If you wish to start with a few existing database entries, import `testData.sql` to the database (again, if using SQLiteStudio, make sure to select the entire query before pressing `run`).
